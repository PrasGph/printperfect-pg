# Technical Efficiency Report

This document provides a summary of the application's performance, security, and overall technical health.

### Performance Triage

-   **Successes**: The implementation of Code Splitting (`React.lazy`) for the `FileUploadModal` and `React.memo` for the `WhyChooseUs` component has successfully improved initial load times and reduced unnecessary re-renders.
-   **Next Bottleneck**: As the application scales, the next significant performance challenge will be handling large data payloads from Sanity. Fetching and rendering large datasets on the client-side without a proper caching and data management strategy will lead to UI lag and a poor user experience.

### CI/CD & Security Status

-   **CI/CD**: The current CI/CD pipeline, managed through GitHub Actions, automatically enforces Eslint checks on every push. This ensures that all new code adheres to the project's quality standards before being merged.
-   **Security**: All sensitive information, such as API keys and other secrets, have been externalized into a `.env` file, which is excluded from version control. This is a critical security measure to prevent accidental exposure of credentials.

### Next Steps Recommendation

To address the upcoming performance bottleneck related to data fetching, it is strongly recommended to implement a client-side data fetching and caching strategy.

-   **Recommendation**: Integrate `@tanstack/react-query` to manage all data fetching from Sanity.
-   **Benefits**:
    -   **Caching**: Drastically reduce the number of requests sent to Sanity by caching data on the client.
    -   **Automatic Refetching**: Keep data fresh without manual intervention.
    -   **Improved UX**: Provide a faster, more responsive user experience by reducing perceived latency when loading and interacting with data.
